# Emergent LLM

This is the code for our paper "Towards predicting Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models" (FMW @ CVPR'24).


## Requirements
- pytorch
- transformers
- tqdm
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Getting started

Run the notebook ``main.ipynb``, which presents our main results, and replicates our experiments. To run all evaluations from scratch (without using the saved results), uncomment the corresponding code block.
